# Gain your life level with [this](https://pyataevsv.github.io/intervalWorkout/) fitness app :sunglasses: :muscle:

**If you like to train in an intrval way you've probably faced with some problems like I did:**
* searching for relevant interval timer
* looking for training programs and exersices
* making different lists to memory your programs
* combining configuration of you proframm with timer settings
* boring from old programs

**In this frontend-only (react+redux) mobile-first app beta-version I've tried to soleve some of this problems.
Main features:**
* flexible interval timer
* ability to cofigure and remember your own trining programms
* compatibility with modern browsers

**Now I'll try this app by my own. I'm shure I will find some bags and a lot of thig to improve an move on!**

**My plans for next version:**
* fix bugs from beta-version
* make some interface improvement with regards to future scalability
* add exercise library
* make versions for android/ios or realize app like PWA
* make some valuable training programs presets
* remove data frome local-storage to back-end
